## Description

Found in this repository is the back end for an API for a social network web application called Highwind. Users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. There is no front-end to this application at this time. To test that the HTTP requests are functioning as expected, the user will need to use an application such as Insomnia or Postman,
